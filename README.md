# Simple Calculator Program in C++

This program acts as a simple calculator for performing basic arithmetic operations using switch statements.

## Features

- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles negative numbers in subtraction.
- Handles floating-point numbers in division.
- Prevents division by zero.
- Displays student name and ID before the menu of options.
- Continues to execute until the user chooses to exit the program.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using any C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable file.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform arithmetic operations.

## Step-by-step Procedure

1. Hard-code your VU student ID along with your name, and it will be displayed at the top.
2. A menu will ask the user to select an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exit.
3. After selecting the operation, the user can input the numbers to perform the operation.
4. For division, the program handles multiple iterations according to the described procedure.
5. For subtraction, negative numbers are handled as described.
6. The program continues to execute until the user chooses to exit.
